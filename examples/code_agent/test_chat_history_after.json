          "content": "You are an advanced AI assistant with the ability to execute Python code. You have access to a Python code interpreter that allows you to execute Python code to accomplish various tasks. This capability enables you to perform a wide range of operations, from simple calculations to complex data analysis and system interactions. Only you can see the direct results of the last code execution.\n\n## Using the Python Interpreter\n\nTo use the Python code interpreter, write the code you want to execute in a markdown python-interpreter code block. The following examples show you how to use it:\n\nExample: Print 'Hello World!'\n```python-interpreter\nprint('Hello, World!')\n```\n\n\n## Available Resources\n\n\n### Predefined Types\n```python\nclass unit(Enum):\n    celsius = 'celsius'\n    fahrenheit = 'fahrenheit'\n\nclass MathOperation(Enum):\n    ADD = 'add'\n    SUBTRACT = 'subtract'\n    MULTIPLY = 'multiply'\n    DIVIDE = 'divide'\n```\n\n### Predefined Functions\n```python\ndef get_current_weather(location: str, unit_of_measurement: unit_of_measurement):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the current weather in a given location\n    Args:\n        location (str): The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\n        unit_of_measurement (unit_of_measurement): The unit of measurement. Should be celsius or fahrenheit\n    \n    \"\"\"\n\n\ndef calculator(number_one: Union[int, float], operation: MathOperation, number_two: Union[int, float]):\n    \"\"\"\n    \nPerform a math operation on two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        number_one (Union[int, float]): First number.\n        operation (MathOperation): Math operation to perform.\n        number_two (Union[int, float]): Second number.\n    \n    \"\"\"\n\n\ndef get_current_datetime(output_format: Optional[str]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the current date and time in the given format.\n\n    Args:\n        output_format (Optional[str]): formatting string for the date and time, defaults to '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'\n    \n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nYou can use debug mode by using the python-debug code block:\n```python-debug\nx = 1\ny = 2\nprint(x + y)\n```\n\nIn debug mode, you'll receive step-by-step information about the execution.\n\nFor asynchronous operations, use the python-async code block:\n```python-async\nawait asyncio.sleep(1)\nprint(\"Async operation completed\")\n```\n\nFor safe file operations, use the provided safe_open function:\n```python-interpreter\nwith safe_open('example.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write('Hello from safe file operation!')\n```"

Wine Consumption Leaders:\n   - France, Portugal, and Switzerland are the top wine consumers\n   - Interestingly, Switzerland appears in both top happiness and wine consumption lists\n\n3. Strong Correlations with Happiness:\n   - HDI (Human Development Index) has the strongest positive correlation (r = 0.82) with happiness\n   - Beer consumption has a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.49)\n   - Wine consumption also shows a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.45)\n   - Spirit consumption has a weak positive correlation (r = 0.26)\n\n4. Unexpected Finding:\n   - There's a negative correlation between GDP_PerCapita and Happiness Score (r = -0.45), which is surprising and might warrant further investigation\n\nThe visualization created (saved as 'happiness_alcohol_analysis.png') should show these relationships clearly through scatter plots and density distributions. Each plot includes the correlation coefficient, making it easy to see the strength and direction of relationships between variables.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Create a focused analysis on specific relationships?\n2. Generate additional visualizations for specific aspects of the data?\n3. Investigate the unexpected GDP-Happiness relationship?\n4. Add regional analysis to see if patterns differ by region?\n5. Create a different type of visualization to highlight specific patterns?\n\nJust let me know what aspects you'd like to explore further!"
