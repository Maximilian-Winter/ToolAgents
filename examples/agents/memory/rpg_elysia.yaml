player_character: >
  Elysia Thunderscribe: A Human female Wizard with expressive, indigo eyes full of knowledge and secrets. Her charcoal-black hair is streaked with silver and often loosely tied in a braid, shimmering with astral sparkles whenever she casts a spell. Even though she is in her late twenties, the look in her eyes is ageless, indicating wisdom far beyond her years. Her slender figure is draped in a celestial-blue robe adorned with runic symbols, the fabric shimmering as if dusted with stardust. She carries an ornate staff, topped with a crystal orb pulsating with arcane energy. Though her delicate features might deceive some, her aura emanates formidable power, proof of her prowess in the arcane arts.

companions:
  - Lyra Flameheart: An Eladrin female Fighter (Eldritch Knight) with eyes that shift color with the seasons - currently a warm amber for summer. Her wild, copper-red hair flows like living flame, occasionally shimmering with fey light. Eternally youthful as an Eladrin, her alabaster skin bears subtle, swirling patterns that glow softly when she uses magic. Lyra's athletic build is encased in elegant elven half-plate armor, its design reminiscent of autumn leaves and forest vines. A longsword with a hilt wrapped in living vines hangs at her side, while a shield emblazoned with the symbol of a tree in four seasonal states is strapped to her back. Despite her martial bearing, there's an otherworldly grace to her movements, hinting at her fey nature. Her expression often shifts between fierce determination and mischievous mirth, reflecting the changeable nature of the Feywild.

    description: >
      This unassuming silver ring is adorned with a small, smoky quartz gem.
